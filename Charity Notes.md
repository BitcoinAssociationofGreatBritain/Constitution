Some notes about becoming a charity
===================================

* The aim is to become a CIO. We can only do this when we can prove our income is over £5000
* Even if we can prove that (and there are questions over when bitcoins are valued as GBP), then there is still a waiting list for small charities. 
* Until we are a CIO there are some liability issues for trustees. However without property, staff and bank accounts it is difficult to see where a liability can occur. Maybe if we start organising events?
* Once a CIO Trusttees liabilities can be removed entirely.

* Aim is to be 100% legitimate and dot the i and cross the ts from the start.
* However I cannot see any reason why BABG cannot adopt a CIO type constitution and claim that it is has a charitible purpose if policy and procedures to safeguard funds are in place.
_*1.2.2 Unincorporated associations*_
_If a group of people come together to pursue a common purpose that does not have the intention of making a profit then an “unincorporated association”, will be formed. Typical examples of unincorporated associations are_:
** parent and teacher associations; and
** local members’ golf and tennis clubs.
_If the activity which the members wish to promote is
“wholly and exclusively” charitable then the unincorporated association will be a charity, and if its turnover exceeds the registration threshold (currently a gross annual income of £5,000 or more) the charity will normally be required to register itself with the Charity Commission._
* We can apply to HMRC by filling in "HMRC Charities Application Form", but need a bank account, which opens up a new set of questions.
** Form needs a postal address (?PO Box?) 
** Reporting of Income in bitcoin using exchange rate BTC/GBP at the date of the report


What we need to do before that:
===============================
* Agree initital constitution - Section askes for details about changes from CIO model
* Agree Founder Trustees
* Agree Wallet protocol - Shared secret >50% of number of trustees to approve spending. Renewal of wallets as trustees join and leave.
* Estimate gross income???
* Agree Address and Phone number
* Agree 2-4 Authorised Officials - Names, Address, NI number, Fit and Proper person declaration.
* Agree plan of activity similar to a business plan
* Agree on Bank Account or not. Benefit is can register with HMRC and membership subs and donations can be gift aided. Disadvantages are that it goes against the vibe of the thing.
