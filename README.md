Constitution
============

Constitution of the organisation (which will hopefully become a Charitable Institution Organisation) known as the Bitcoin Association of Great Britain (bagb)

So what is it?
============

The aim is to create a legal charity for the promotion of bitcoin in the UK.

Why?
============

Because bitcoin take up is very low in the UK but there are a bunch of committed bitcoin meetup enthusiasts who want to change this.

Who are you to organise this?
============
My name is Lee Adams. I am a Security Cleared IT consultant who happens to own a small amount of bitcoin. I am a spiritualist who can see the enoromous potential of bitcoin. Organised correctly, this could change the world. I am passionate to find ways to harness this change for the betterment of mankind. E.G. I imagine a world (maybe this year) in which I can make tax-deducted donations to charity via bitcoin just by scanning a barcode (maybe from a passing train). We all know that bitcoin already has it's darker uses. We now need to concentrate on it's lighter side. 

I currently work for a business process management firm and have the ability to create rich form html5 websites quickly and mostly paid for by bitcoin. I am currently working on bitcoinux.com and bagb.org.uk. The main constraint is to find an service provider who accepts bitcoin and can respond to urgent support queries in less than 5 days!

Finally I have included the clause in the constitution that I will resign as charity trustee as soon as the first meeting is organised. I am more than happy to take a back seat if not re-elected.

What is the central values of this organisation?
============
Well ultimately that will be up to it's members. Every member should have equal rights and the vision is to use decentralised cryptography to embed that into a rules protocol that means no-one can subvert the intention of a majority of it's members. I have prepared draft objects and drafted a way to use bitcoin to vote. It will now be up to the members to refine these.

Is this a legal charity?
============
Currently there is a waiting list for new charities to be accepted by the charities commission, but in the meantime I have made every effort to abide by the UK charities' acts. As far as an organisation goes; it now has a draft constitution. As a bitcoin organisation does not need a bank, all I now need is at least 2 more volunteer 'charity trustees' to get together and create an offline wallet for funds. My plan is to either split the private key up or encrypt the wallet with a shared secret (2 of 3?) so that the organisation is bullet proof from its very beginning. I know my psuedo-crypto plan is probably shit and there is a lot of work to do as I am very new at cryptography!

Development
============
The plan is to push the boundaries of cryptographic currencies to facilitate the voting mechanism and decentralise control. Microtransactions, Coloured Coin, Multi-signature and Escrow transactions etc. In researching this, I discovered liquid democracy (e.g. http://dev.liquidfeedback.org/lf2/) and while I disagree with illegal filesharing, the pirate parties have a lot going for them in terms of organisation.

What about bitcoin foundation?
============
I have just joined as a member and love what bitcoin foundation is doing. However I disagree with its bye laws. Specifically I strongly feel that members should have equal rights, either as founders or by paying more money. I do however think it is wise that bagb should be associated with the bitcoin foundation. It's also worth noting clause 27 of bagb's constitution! ;)

Why did you unilaterally decide to change [such and such] a clause in the constitution?
============
In accordance with the above values. I hope to add to this faq all the rationales behine every decision so that it can be healthily debated amongst members and not unilaterally decided. Unfortunately it is now half past midniht and I still have a day job.
