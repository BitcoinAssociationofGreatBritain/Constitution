Why require a phone number?
===========================

Trustees need to ensure that the membership is not being abused or purchased by one individual having multiple memberships. While the phone number might never be used, if suspisions of this nature are raised it allows the trustees to make enquiries and justify a decision to ban a member. It also helps ensure that only UK residents are members.

Who decides that the conditions set out in Clause 10.3 (e) are met?
===================================================================

This clause is about the members rights to make a proposal for decision by the members. Trustees are allowed to turn it down under certain conditions. 

If the members disagree with the trustees decision they can organise an AGM and ultimately kick the trustees out.

Do Trustees have liability?
===========================
I have no idea as I am not a lawyer. However the whole point of a CIO is to limit the Trustees liability similar to that of managers at a limited company.

What does Clause 11.2 (i) mean exactly? Do trustees have personal liability?
============================================================================
I have no idea as I am not a lawyer. I would love to talk to some one who can interpret this. I am not concerned about this liability (if it exists) as I doubt that this clause would ever need to be invoked and if it did something would be very wrong with the trustees competence or trustworthyness.

Sub-clause 11.3 (b) refers to subclause 11.3(a) which refers to notice for general meetings, but this sub-clause talks about passing resolutions. 
=================================================================================================================================================
Wow, where to start? Trustees have to notify members about a general meeting. This is to protect the individual members who may not be aware that a quorate meeting is taking place.

If the trustees have not notified members, then any resolutions taken at that meeting are not in order. However this clause states that if at least 90% of the membership vote for something at that meeting (regardless of whether everyone was notified), then the resolution *IS* in order.

I guess what this is saying is that if 90% of the membership turn up and agree to something, then the 10% cannot complain that due process was not followed in order to stop/reverse the resolution. To my mind this clause is a bit overkill and Robert's rules cover this eventuality so it is not strictly needed. It is in the template text of a CIO, so it is better it stays in so BAGB can become a CIO.

Why does the constitution require hard copies?
==============================================
This is a legal requirement to protect members of an organisation that do not utilise computers. Even though it does not apply to our membership (as members are require to futher the objects of the charity and one of these objects is to reduce inefficient paper), it cannot be removed/ or if it was removed would still be a requirement as the law of the UK would override any clause in the constitution.

Why does altering the objects require the writen consent of the Charities Commission?
=====================================================================================
This clause would only come into affect once the charity has become a CIO. The objects must be wholely charitible and benefect the public. Therefore the Charity Commision have to check these objects match that in the first place and check any changes do not make a CIO profit making etc.

Why is payment made in BTC, but specified in GBP?
=================================================
Bitcoin is not a perfect system and is subject to volitility. To be fair to all members the less volitile GBP rate is used so that members are paying approximately the same fees. This will come up for debate a lot, but my opinion is that it is fairer this way. We need to educate the public about both the benefits and drawbacks of bitcoin. The volitility is probably bitcoin's biggest drawback. Also while bitcoin is very much the focus of this charity, it's members are British residents so use of GBP is appropriate.
